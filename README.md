OVERVIEW
HackerEarth is back with another Full-stack developement hackathon. Welcome to StackHack 2.0, inviting all developers and hackathon enthusiasts to come up with fantastic ideas to build minimal viable products from scratch. Code your way from the backend to the frontend and design products to inspire!

It’s true that being a specialist in one’s field and gaining mastery of a particular aspect of technology has distinct advantages, but as technology rapidly expands and evolves, industries are constantly changing. With this change comes the need for skills branching out to multiple technologies and the ability to build end to end products to potentially transform the way people live around the world.

This hackathon is open to all developers who have an eye for design and a passion for code. Participants can either hack individually or as a team of four. Take advantage of this opportunity to learn with other teams, showcase your talent, and compete for prizes!
